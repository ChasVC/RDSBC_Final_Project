# RDSBC_Final_Project

Initial attempt to create a solution for stakeholders of Podcast & Long-form spoken word companies who wish to leverage ratings and review information in their business decisions. While the intial driver of this work was to complete the final assingment for Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp, it's since been learned that a real-world need may exist. 


## To-Do's

- Rough outline of what's to be built
- Find existing data sources that approximates what would be used in Production
- Create mockup in Excel using dummy data and/or test data and any known methods
- Decide on mid and long-term plans including tech
- Write some user stories to build against
- Write requirements


## The Plan

- Initial data source --> [Kaggle Podcast Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews?resource=download)
- Download data source to local
- Pull data into Excel via Power Query, and handle transforms within
- Create a Date Table (or connect to online source?)
- Output Data and Date Table to Excel Data Model and add measures for basic KPIs such as Number of Reviews, Max/Min/Avg
- Connect Data & Date Table
- Output Pivot to Excel tab and build out mockup.
- Will need to do something that mimics Sentiment Analysis. Will need to determine best method, probably via [Python](https://www.unite.ai/10-best-python-libraries-for-sentiment-analysis/)

		- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
		- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

	### Installing

	A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
	environment running

	Say what the step will be

	    Give the example

	And repeat

	    until finished

	End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


	## Running the tests

		Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

	### Sample Tests

		Explain what these tests test and why

    			Give an example

	### Style test

		Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.

	    Give an example
